# Glassbox Models Example

Wished you could have a highly performative algorithm that was also easy to interpet? Well, in the famous words of icon Hannah Montanah, you can now have the best of both worlds! 

Explainable boosting machines (EBMs) leverage the performance of boosted trees while also providing built in local and global explanations. P.S. - if you want to speed things up, you can also utilize ONNX and synapseML to run your EBMs in Spark!

This repo will walk you through an end to end EBM project covering each step of the data science pipeline:
* Creating a Virtual Environment For Your Code 
* Exploratory Data  Analysis
* Splitting Your Data
* Dealing with Missing Values
* Dealing with Correlated Variables
* Dealing with Outliers
* Feature Engineering
* Standardization / Normalization
* Putting Everything Above In A Sklearn Pipeline
* Model Tuning with Hyperopt
* Explaining Your Model

NOTE: The base functionalities are there, but I will be adding more explanations and cleaning up these notebooks. The most up to date version will always be on the 'dev' branch.
